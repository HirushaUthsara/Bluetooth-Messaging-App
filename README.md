# Bluetooth-Messaging-App
The aim is to build a mobile application to carry out two-way chat over Bluetooth. This application helps users to chat via bluetooth. Other than normal two-way chat scenarios, users create unique groups (channels) and administrators can send invitations to join or if the users know group details, they can send requests to get joined. When administrators scan users in the range for a particular group, the application should list all the users who are in the range and the users who are not in the range.
